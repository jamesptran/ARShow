This is a simple demo of the capabilities of Augmented Reality technology for realistic rendering of 3D objects outdoor.

To try out the project, open and compile ARShow.xcworkspace to a device with support for arkit capabilities (devices that have A9, A10 or A11 chip)
Once you have installed it on the device, wave around any surface so that the phone can detect the surface. 
After you have a surface detected, you can tap on the surface to project a 3D chair on top of the surface. 
It is recommended to try to project the chair on the ground instead of on the table or other surfaces, since the chair is quite big. (A normal sized chair)
